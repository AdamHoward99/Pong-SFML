## How To Use
To play the game immediately, run the game's exe which is located in the bin folder. To test out the code, you will require the SFML 2.5.1 libraries stored in the folder up from the solution file in order to prevent include errors from showing up. The application is supported on Windows OS and is playable using only the keyboard.
